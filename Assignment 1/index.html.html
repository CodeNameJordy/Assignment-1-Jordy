          <li><u>Surfing</u></li>
           <p>This sport has been my favorite hobby since I was a small kid.
           <br> It has been my source of stress relief, excercise and mostly fun. 
           <br> Bali, Indonesia has been one of my best surf trips so far! 
           <br> I can't wait to travel more of the world.

          <li><u>Drones</u></li>
           <p>I have only recently started flying drones.
           <br> After I got my first one as a birthday gift last year.
           <br> Video's and photography have always been an interest of mine.
           <br> But taking to the air with it has been incredible!

          <li><u>Whale Sharks</u></li>
           <p>This has been my favorite sea animal since I started surfing.
           <br> The fact that it is both a shark and a whale is so interesting.
           <br> It's amazing the way it glides in the water and the pattern it has.
           <br> I have been very fortunate to swim with one in the wild.

          <li><u>Leopards</u></li>
          <p>Unfotunately I have not seen my favorite land animal in the wild yet!
          <br> I think thats why I love it so much, its ability to be hidden in plain sight.
          <br> Its fur pattern is also like the whale shark, so different and amazing.
          <br> Hopefully I will get to see one someday soon!

        <h2>My claim to fame</h2>
        <p>I had a video back in 2014 go semi-viral on YouTube.
        <br> Where two skaters I knew had some really hectic bails.
        <br> The video became very popular, and has aired on international TV.
        <br> We were all paid some dollars for the videography and to be featured.
        <br> The video can be found below!
